<h2>Lab exercises</h2>

<p>The lab exercises are found under <tt>student-luk-1.0.3/lab</tt>.
For each lab exercise you will need to:
</p>

<div class="itemize">
<dl>
<dt><tt>(i)</tt></dt>
<dd><p>modify <tt>student-luk-1.0.3/Makefile.in</tt> to reflect the
exercise being undertaken. This only needs to be done once.
</p>

</dd><dt><tt>(ii)</tt></dt>
<dd><p>edit the appropriate file inside each lab directory and complete
the code. Now you need to go through the edit, compile, build, run
cycle until the code is perfect! Remember to <tt>make bootdisk</tt>
every time you want to test your code!
</p>

</dd></dl>
</div>
<p>Each sub section below corresponds to a sub directory under
<tt>student-luk-1.0.3/lab</tt>.
</p>

<a name="section6"></a>
<h3>hello</h3>

<p>In this directory is a simple application which just prints ``hello world''
to the screen and terminates. It is a minimal application which tests
whether the microkernel can build and boot correctly. This example is
complete and does not require any source code changes.
</p>

<p>You need to modify the <tt>Makefile.in</tt> and set the <tt>APPLICATION</tt>
variable to <tt>hello</tt>. So the top of <tt>Makefile.in</tt> should look
like this:
</p>

<pre>#
# ================
# Makefile for luk
# ================
#
# You can configure the microkernel building in the following
# lines of code
# 
# uncomment _one_ of the following APPLICATIONs to build an
# appropriate microkernel
#
#
APPLICATION=hello
# APPLICATION=debug
# APPLICATION=scn
# APPLICATION=boundedbuffer
etc etc
</pre>

<a name="section7"></a>
<h3>debug</h3>

<p>In this exercise you should implement the function DebugString inside
the file <tt>Debug.c</tt>. Notice that there are two parameters to
DebugString the pointer to the start of the string and the maximum
number of characters which maybe in the string.
</p>

<p>All characters from the pointer up until the <tt>&lt;nul&gt;</tt> character
<tt>(char)0</tt> should be emitted. No more than the maximum number of
characters should be emitted, in case there is no trailing
<tt>(char)0</tt>.
</p>

<p>There is an initial attempt of <tt>Debug.c</tt> in this directory and
this can be built using the generic building instructions found in
this document.
</p>

<p>Your function <tt>DebugString</tt> must check for the character sequence
'\' 'n' and this should be cause a newline to be printed. Hint you
should call <tt>WriteLn</tt>.
<a name="section8"></a>
</p>

<h3>scn</h3>

<p>In this exercise you should complete the screen device driver Scn.c.
</p>

<p>There is an initial attempt of <tt>Scn.c</tt> in this directory and this
can be built using the generic building instructions found in this
document. You need to complete the function <tt>ScrollUp</tt> which
should move each line up the screen and then finally blank the bottom
line.
</p>

<p>The screen can be accessed via the pointer to array
<tt>(*screen)[j][i]</tt>. The screen top row is accessed via
<tt>(*screen)[0][i]</tt>. Where <tt>i</tt> can have any value
<tt>0..Width-1</tt> which represents the columns (left to right).
<a name="section9"></a>
</p>

<h3>boundedbuffer</h3>

<p>In this exercise you must complete the bounded buffer module as discussed
in the lecture.
</p>

<p>There is an initial attempt of BufferDevice.c in this directory and
this can be built using the generic building instructions found in
this document. Your task is to finish the two functions
<tt>BufferDevice_InitBuffer</tt> and <tt>BufferDevice_ReadBuffer</tt>.
Both functions have been discussed in the lectures and their
associated notes.
<a name="section10"></a>
</p>

<h3>executive</h3>

<p>In this exercise you should complete the functions Resume and Wait
in the executive.
</p>

<p>There is an initial attempt of Executive.c in this directory and this can
be built using the generic building instructions found in this document.
<a name="section11"></a>
</p>

<h3>timerhandler</h3>

<p>In this exercise you should complete the functions ArmEvent and Timer
in the file <tt>timerhandler/TimerHandler.c</tt>.
</p>

<p>There is an initial attempt of <tt>TimerHandler.c</tt> in this directory
and this can be built using the generic building instructions found in
this document.
<a name="section12"></a>
</p>

<h3>processes</h3>

<p>In this directory is an application which runs three processes running
in separate windows. It is a test application which demonstrates that
the Executive and Interrupts are functioning in the microkernel. This
example is complete and does not require any source code modifications.
<a name="section13"></a>
</p>

<h3>combined</h3>

<p>This does not require any extra work, but allows students to see
their combined C files all working in the microkernel. It will have
been necessary to complete all previous exercises (bug free) to see
this successfully work.
