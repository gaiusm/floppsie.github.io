<p><ul type=disc> <li> Linus Torvalds a Finnish student at
the University of Helsinki wrote Linux <li> famous posting
to <tt><small>comp.os.minix</small></tt> on 25 August 1991
read: <li></p>

<pre>Hello everybody out there... I&rsquo;m doing a (free) operating system</pre>


<p><li> sealed his fate.. <li> initially Linux was not
designed for portability <ul type=square> <li> but only to
run on the 386 architecture </ul> <li> started out as
&lsquo;&lsquo;for fun&rsquo;&rsquo; to run
<tt><small>bash</small></tt> and <tt><small>gcc</small></tt>
on his &lsquo;&lsquo;toy&rsquo;&rsquo; operating system
<ul type=square> <li> Linus started by utilising the file
system code of Minix in Linux </ul> <li> later on he found
that good design principles led the way to portability for
purity&rsquo;s sake alone <ul type=square> <li> other people
helped porting Linux to other architectures </ul> <li> Linux
initially used components of Minix (which was later totally
replaced) <ul type=square> <li> it also heavily used the
<tt><small>gcc</small></tt> compiler extensions (such as
assembly language in macros and header files) </ul> <li>
again avoided the NIH syndrome, certainly
&lsquo;&lsquo;stole&rsquo;&rsquo; the ideas of
<tt><small>UNIX</small></tt> <ul type=square> <li> pipes,
sockets, files, IO etc. <br>

<h2>7. GNU History
<a name="7. GNU History"></a>

<p><ul type=disc> <li> the <small>GNU</small> project
started in 1984 to develop a complete <small>UNIX</small>
like operating system which is free software
<ul type=square> <li> &lsquo;&lsquo;free&rsquo;&rsquo; as in
speech and but not as in beer </ul> <li> Richard Stallman
started the GNU project and began work upon
<tt><small>gcc</small></tt> , <tt><small>emacs</small></tt>
and <tt><small>gdb</small></tt> . <li> all GNU software is
licenced through the GPL <li> in the early days the each
software component had to be complete written from scratch
<ul type=square> <li> so that it could be completely owned
by the GNU foundation </ul> <li> more recently, almost
nothing is written from scratch anymore
<ul type=square> <li> as each new software component borrows
heavily from other GNU software components</p>

<p></ul> </ul></p><hr>

<h2>8. GPL designed to uphold Free Software
<a name="8. GPL designed to uphold Free Software"></a>
</h2>


<p><ul type=disc> <li> it provides <li> the freedom to run
the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). <li> the freedom
to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs
(freedom 1) <ul type=square> <li> access to the source code
is a precondition for this. </ul> <li> the freedom to
redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour (freedom
2) <li> the freedom to improve the program, and release your
improvements to the public, so that the whole community
benefits (freedom 3) <ul type=square> <li> access to the
source code is a precondition for this.</p>

<h2>9. Software engineering implications of GPL
<a name="9. Software engineering implications of GPL"></a>
</h2>


<p><ul type=disc> <li> liberally encouraged to
&lsquo;&lsquo;borrow&rsquo;&rsquo; code from other projects
<ul type=square> <li> encouraged to re-factor borrowed code
if you extend a project (rather than to duplicate code with
minor variants) </ul> <li> libraries are constructed at both
the source level and also at the object level
<ul type=square> <li> tremendous productivity gain compared
to closed source development <li> todays new GPL project can
become tomorrows library of source code </ul> <li> software
engineers advocate code reuse - but often miss the most
important component <ul type=square> <li> source code
reuse</p>

<h2>10. UNIX Philosophy in a nutshell
<a name="10. UNIX Philosophy in a nutshell"></a>
</h2>


<p><ul type=disc> <li> small is beautiful
<ul type=square> <li> small software programs are generally
fast <li> they are often combined with other software
programs in useful ways (often unseen by original author)
<li> any advance in computer speed will have a noticeable
effect on a small program </ul> <li> make each program do
one thing well <ul type=square> <li> removes extraneous
code, removes complexity and improves flexibility </ul> <li>
build a prototype as soon as possible <li> choose
portability over efficiency <li> store data in flat text
files <ul type=square> <li> all configuration files are
plain text </ul> <li> use software leverage to your
advantage <ul type=square> <li> source code reuse </ul> <li>
use shell scripts where possible <ul type=square> <li> try
to avoid writing an equivalent C program </ul> <li> avoid
captive interfaces <li> make every program a filter</p>

<h2>11. UNIX and GNU/Linux culture/goals
<a name="11. UNIX and GNU/Linux culture/goals"></a>
</h2>


<p><ul type=disc> <li> allow the user to tailor the
environment <li> make operating system kernels small and
lightweight <ul type=square> <li> not always achieved but
certainly a goal <li> see GNU Hurd </ul> <li> use lowercase
and keep it short <li> save trees <li> silence is golden
<li> think parallel <li> sum of the parts is greater than
the whole <ul type=square> <li> large applications are built
from smaller programs (eg shell scripts) </ul> <li> look for
90% solution <ul type=square> <li> doing 90% of the solution
is much easier and will satisfy 90% of the user base </ul>
<li> worse is better <ul type=square> <li> inclusive and
least common denominator is likely to survive <li> worse is
likely to be cheaper and thus more popular </ul> <li> think
hierarchically</p>

</ul> <li> second system of Man <ul type=square> <li> built
by so called experts <li> built by much design and attention

algorithms of the first system <ul type=square> <li> often
fall into the NIH syndrome </ul> <li> second system designed
by a committee <ul type=square> <li> overweight software
which is slow <li> does not yield huge benefits from
increases in compute power </ul> <li> second system is a
success and failure <ul type=square> <li> extra features

software</p>

<small>GNU/L</small> inux <li> much of the implementation is
written correctly <ul type=square> <li> developers have had

<h2>15. GNU/Linux as a second system

<p><ul type=disc> <li> arguably it is using a second system
methodology <ul type=square> <li> namely OpenSource or Free
Software </ul> <li> remember these generate much excitement

many books <ul type=square> <li> many conferences,
symposiums, journals etc</p>
